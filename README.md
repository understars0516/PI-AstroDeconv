We present a straightforward and efficient approach for blind image deblurring by integrating the principles of telescope imaging and deep learning. According to telescope imaging principles, when a signal is observed through a telescope, it undergoes smoothing due to the telescope's beam or PSF, resulting in signal blurring. To tackle this issue, we incorporate a convolution kernel resembling a telescope's beam or PSF into a conventional network. We then perform a deconvolution process on the intermediate outputs to restore image clarity. The proposed model is trained end-to-end and comprehensively evaluated using both simulated and real-world image blur scenarios. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in deblurring performance achieved by the proposed De_Conv deconvolution network.
